# L0 - Machine Learning Intuition using KNIME

## Objective

- Learn how to build basic Machine Learning models using KNIME
- Build Top 5 Use Cases in Machine Learning
	+ Classification
	+ Regression
	+ Clustering
	+ Forecasting
	+ Text Classification

### Classification
Classification models are a subset of supervised machine learning . 
A classification model reads some input and generates an output that classifies the input into some category. 
For example, a model might read an email and classify it as either spam or not â€” binary classification.

### Regression
Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. 
It's used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.


## Next Steps

### 1/ Preprocessing

- Missing Values Treatment
	- Numerical - Mean, Median, Mode
	- Categorical - Most Frequent, Constant
- Outlier Treatment
	- Numerical - Quartile Method
- Transformation
	- Numerical - Standard Scaler
	- Categorical - *Not Required in KNIME*
		+ Ensure Categories are less
